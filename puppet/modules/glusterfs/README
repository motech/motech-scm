# Overview

Install, enable and configure GlusterFS.

* `glusterfs::server` : Class to install and enable the server.
* `glusterfs::peer` : Definition to add a server peer. Used by the server class' $peer parameter.
* `glusterfs::volume` : Definition to create server volumes.
* `glusterfs::client` : Class to install and enable the client. Included from the mount definition.
* `glusterfs::mount` : Definition to create client mounts.

You will need to open TCP ports 24007:24009 and 38465:38466 on the servers.

# Example Usage

## Sample GlusterFS setup (with replication) for two machines 192.168.42.1(primary) and 192.168.42.2(secondary), IN ORDER

1. On 192.168.42.2, installing glusterfs without a peer:
    class { 'glusterfs::server' :  }

2. On 192.168.42.1, installing and making both aware of the peer - the reason for which glusterfs was installed in secondary first, so that peer setup is replicated to secondary:
    $peer = "192.168.42.2"
    class { 'glusterfs::server' : peers => "${peer}" }

3. Setting up volume with replication on either 192.168.42.1 or 192.168.42.2:
    $volumeName = "activemq-cluster-volume"
    $volumeCreationOptions = "replica 2 transport tcp 192.168.42.1:/home/motech/apache-activemq-5.5.1/data 192.168.42.2:/home/motech/apache-activemq-5.5.1/data"
    glusterfs::volume { "${volumeName}" : create_options => "${volumeCreationOptions}" }

4. Mounting volume on both machines:
    $mountPoint = "/mnt/activemq_data/"
    $volumeToMount = "192.168.42.1:/activemq-cluster-volume"
    glusterfs::mount { "${mountPoint}" : device => "${volumeToMount}" }

    $mountPoint = "/mnt/activemq_data"
    $volumeToMount = "192.168.42.1:/activemq-cluster-volume"
    glusterfs::mount { "${mountPoint}" : device => "${volumeToMount}" }
